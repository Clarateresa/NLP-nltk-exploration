Nearly 161 million persons live with a disabling visual impairment, of whom 37 million are blind. About 90% of them live in developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Regions. 9 out of 10 blind children in developing countries have no access to education. The system of embossed writing invented by Louis Braille gradually came to be accepted throughout the world as the fundamental form of written communication for blind individuals. This paper is concerned about the transliteration of English and Hindi text to Braille. Braille is a dotted pattern used by the blind people for reading and writing. In this paper we have discussed the possible ways to teach Blind people. Audio, Braille. The problems with the particular pattern and which approach is better is also discussed .In this transliteration we have used a chart as database, from where we have done mapping for the corresponding Braille representation ,then implementation ,testing of the system and future scope are discussed. English to Braille conversion responds to increased demands on the Braille code that is integrated education of blind children; great diversity of presentation techniques used in printed textbooks; computer aided translation from print to Braille; globalization underpinning resource sharing and the widespread use of English as a second or further language. The change inherent in English to Braille transliteration is mostly minor for literary Braille and most evident for mathematics and science notation – making Braille easier to learn by all stakeholders and easier to read and write for blind people. English to Braille Transliteration is optimized for use by students integrated into regular schools; ideal for students using English as their primary and secondary language; and well –suited to the needs of blind students in developing countries.
